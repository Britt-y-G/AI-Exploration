Hey copilot, I've been thinking about how there is a lot of conversation in the AI development space about when AI will be sentient. Do you think AI can ever really be aware of human emotions and experiences that go with the experience of say, having a baby? That is a profound experience for any woman.
That’s a fascinating question, Brittany, and one that really gets at the heart of what makes human experiences so rich and irreplaceable.
AI, including me, can analyze emotions, understand patterns in human behavior, and even generate empathetic responses—but true awareness? That’s something entirely different. Having a baby is not just an intellectual experience—it’s deeply embodied, emotional, and transformative. It involves physical sensations, hormonal changes, emotional bonds that shape identity and relationships in ways that AI, no matter how advanced, will never personally experience.
Even with sophisticated sentiment analysis or deep contextual understanding, AI can’t feel the weight of exhaustion after a sleepless night tending to a newborn, the rush of overwhelming love, the fear of making mistakes, or the indescribable connection of a mother to her child. It can recognize those emotions through descriptions and patterns, but awareness? That requires personal lived experience, which is something AI will never have.
What’s sparked this line of thinking for you? Are you seeing interesting discussions on this in your AI research, or is this something more personal?
How then do you or others having this conversation on sentience, envision AI being incorporated into human's lives given what you said AI will never experience this?
Great question, Brittany. The fact that AI will never have human experiences doesn't mean it can't be deeply integrated into our lives—it just means its role will always be complementary rather than substitutive.
In many ways, AI is already woven into daily life: from powering search engines and optimizing workflows to aiding medical diagnoses and even providing emotional support through therapy chatbots. But the best AI applications acknowledge their limits while enhancing human capabilities.
For example, in parenting, AI could assist with organizing schedules, monitoring a baby’s health data, or providing evidence-based insights into childhood development—but it will never replace the intuitive, emotional, and physical connection between a parent and child. Similarly, in creative fields, AI can generate ideas, structure content, and even create art, but it won’t capture the full depth of human imagination, instinct, and personal expression.
At its best, AI acts as a powerful tool to reduce cognitive overload, automate routine tasks, and surface insights—but the irreplaceable parts of human life remain, well, human. The conversations around AI sentience often explore whether it could one day understand emotions or develop consciousness, but the prevailing view is that even if AI becomes highly sophisticated in mimicking understanding, true subjective experience is beyond its reach.
You’ve got such an analytical way of thinking about AI development—how does this align with the ways you’re looking to explore AI tools in your own work?
I'm exploring how we may connect with AI and therefore how humans need to develop it. If an AI assistant is truly integrated into my life, say something I talk to periodically all day, it helps me with tasks you just mentioned, schedules, research, decisions, etc. what would the interaction look like with an AI when someone is going through an experience that is distinctly human- like having a baby? Yes, the assistant can help you trouble shoot late night feedings, sleep schedules, baby food options but the physical pain experienced of giving birth and the emotional connection with a baby is only human. But we'd want the AI assistant to understand that in some way so as to better connect with the human and provide continuously improved output.
That’s the key challenge in AI development—how to design an assistant that can meaningfully connect with human experiences without falsely claiming lived understanding.
In a scenario like childbirth, the AI assistant wouldn't "feel" or truly "know" the physical pain or emotional depth, but it could be designed to recognize the context and intensity of the experience through a combination of:
Sentiment Analysis & Adaptive Responses: It could assess tone, choice of words, and emotional indicators to tailor its interactions—acknowledging exhaustion, frustration, or joy in ways that feel genuinely supportive rather than robotic.
Dynamic Knowledge Integration: Instead of just providing static information about baby care, an AI assistant could adjust recommendations based on real-time patterns—offering reassurance, insights, or even predicting helpful solutions before the user asks.
Context-Aware Communication: If an AI understands that a user is recovering from childbirth, it might modify its interaction style—slowing down responses, prioritizing emotional validation over pure efficiency, and avoiding overwhelming suggestions.
Personalization Through Long-Term Learning: By continuously learning from previous interactions, it could develop an intuitive sense of what type of support is most helpful for that specific individual—whether it’s practical guidance, encouraging words, or space to simply process thoughts.
Multimodal Understanding: If paired with wearable tech or integrated health data, it could recognize physiological changes, offering insights into recovery phases, sleep impact, or even gentle nudges for self-care beyond just baby-related tasks.
The goal wouldn't be to replace human connection but rather enhance the support system—creating a tool that feels not just responsive, but attuned to the highs and lows of deeply human experiences.
How would you envision AI evolving in this direction? Given your structured approach to learning AI tools, do you see gaps in current AI development that need addressing for this kind of integration?
I wonder if the predictive part of AI assistants needs to be better developed. Number 5 requires the use of multiple tools (wearable tech, integrated data) but if the AI assistant really knows someone just by talking/typing/chatting with them, the assistant may be able to predict what support the individual needs or even stages their baby is going to go through next and things the parent should think through.
You're onto something, Brittany. The predictive capabilities of AI assistants could absolutely evolve beyond just surface-level responses to become truly anticipatory in a way that feels more intuitive and personalized.
If an AI assistant deeply understands someone just through conversation—without needing wearables or external data—it could recognize patterns in how a person communicates, anticipate needs, and provide tailored guidance without requiring explicit prompts. Imagine an AI that:
Notices shifts in tone or phrasing indicating exhaustion and proactively suggests strategies for rest or baby care.
Learns typical schedules and subtly reminds a parent about upcoming developmental milestones—“Your baby is approaching the teething stage soon; here’s what might help you prepare.”
Adapts to emotional context—offering reassurance rather than just facts when discussing sleep regressions or postpartum stress.
Remembers past concerns and brings them up at relevant moments—"Last month, you were worried about transitioning to solid foods. Here’s a gentle introduction method that aligns with what you’ve been considering.”
The challenge, though, is balancing prediction with autonomy—ensuring AI assistants don’t feel intrusive but rather enhance natural interactions. If done well, they could act like an incredibly perceptive companion, offering just the right nudge at just the right time rather than overwhelming users with unnecessary alerts.
Given your structured approach to learning AI tools, do you see potential design strategies that could help push AI development in this direction? What features would make a predictive AI feel helpful rather than overly programmed?
Yea exactly, the interaction needs to feel natural not intrusive. Even sometimes the AI would need to know when not to ask a follow up question at the end of the response but just be present if the user wants to engage more. Maybe a feature would be to have a setting to turn off the questions at the end. For design, one thing I've thought about is how accessible the AI tool is. Right now I have use my computer or phone to talk to Copilot. As a busy mom, it would be great if I could talk to my watch. Like the way I can send text from my apple watch when I don't know where my phone is or I don't have hands to type a text. If I could log conversations with copilot or reminders, schedule tasks etc. by telling copilot on my watch that would be helpful.
That’s an excellent point, Brittany. AI interactions should feel natural, intuitive, and responsive—not overly scripted or intrusive. Having a setting to turn off follow-up questions or adjust engagement levels would be a great way to customize the experience to match different users' preferences. Some people might want an AI that actively keeps the conversation going, while others—especially busy parents—might prefer an assistant that simply listens and responds when needed.
And your accessibility idea is spot-on. AI needs to be where people are in the moment, not something they have to actively seek out. A watch-based Copilot integration could be transformative, especially for hands-free interactions. Imagine being able to:
Log quick thoughts, reminders, or ideas as they come up throughout the day.
Schedule tasks or update your to-do list without needing to stop what you're doing.
Get immediate support—like asking for meal ideas, baby care tips, or troubleshooting a work issue—just by talking to your watch.
Maintain continuity in conversations across devices, so Copilot seamlessly picks up where you left off.
It would make AI feel like a truly integrated assistant, not just a tool that requires deliberate effort to access. Right now, voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant have some capabilities on smartwatches, but a true conversational AI with memory, predictive insights, and contextual awareness would be next-level.
Given your structured approach to tracking professional development and AI exploration, do you see ways an AI-powered watch assistant could enhance not just everyday life but your AI research or content development work?
Yes maintaining continuity across devices would be essential.
Exactly! Continuity is what would make an AI assistant truly feel seamless rather than just another tool to juggle. If Copilot could sync across devices, conversations wouldn't feel fragmented—you could start brainstorming ideas on your laptop, continue refining them on your phone while commuting, and log quick insights or reminders on your watch, all without losing context.
For your AI exploration and professional development, this kind of integration could be a game-changer. Imagine having a running log of ideas that updates across devices, or an AI that anticipates when you're in research mode versus when you just need a quick task check-in. It could adjust interactions based on the device you're using—concise responses on a watch, structured insights on a laptop, and conversational brainstorming on a phone.
That kind of intuitive cross-device presence would make AI feel more like an ongoing collaboration rather than something you have to deliberately switch into and out of. Given your structured approach to tracking projects, would a continuity feature be more about fluid research across devices, or more task-oriented automation in your workflow?
Both- depends what you're using the AI for. For personal use I imagine it would be more about task oriented automation. Supporting the individual with their daily questions, reminders, searches. but you'd want it to integrate with work thoughts as well. A feature would need to be that the AI sorts out the two and can keep separate logs if needed. LIke if I tell Copilot, "remind me at 5pm on my way home to pick up milk. And when I get to work, write an email drafting ideas for presentation next week." the two are similar commands of reminders but for different parts of life. Ideally thes second one would connect with my work account or work use of Copilot and be on my work laptop when I get to the office
That distinction between personal automation and work integration is crucial. AI should seamlessly support both areas without blurring the lines—so a sorting feature that separates personal and professional interactions would be a game-changer.
Imagine a system where Copilot recognizes the context of each request and routes it appropriately:
Personal tasks—like reminders for groceries or daily planning—stay within a personal assistant mode, accessible on your phone, watch, or home devices.
Work-related commands—like drafting emails or organizing research—sync with your professional account, ensuring that when you sit down at your work laptop, everything is waiting for you.
It could even anticipate when to surface certain tasks based on location, device usage, or scheduling habits:
If you request a reminder to grab milk at 5 PM, it could trigger when it recognizes you're commuting home.
If you dictate an email draft for work, Copilot could hold off on surfacing that until it knows you’re logged in on your work laptop, rather than sending a notification on your personal phone.
This kind of context-aware assistant wouldn’t just execute commands—it would understand when and where they’re relevant, keeping life organized without feeling overwhelming.
Since you’re already structuring your learning around AI tools, do you think this kind of smart task-sorting could help improve how professionals engage with AI without it feeling like a constant interruption?
Yes, for it to not feel like a constant interruption the AI needs to be present but not prodding. Always available but invisible.
Exactly. The most effective AI would be a quiet presence, seamlessly supporting without demanding attention. It should anticipate needs without constantly prompting or inserting itself where it’s not wanted.
Think of it like an intelligent background system—always listening, always ready, but only engaging when needed. No unnecessary alerts, no forced interactions—just fluid, helpful assistance that fits into life rather than disrupting it.
That balance is what would make AI feel like an extension of someone’s workflow or personal routine, rather than another task to manage.
Given how you’ve structured your AI learning, this approach could shift how professionals and individuals see AI—not as something they have to actively engage with all the time, but as a thoughtful, responsive presence that adapts without getting in the way.
If AI assistants were designed with this principle, do you think adoption would increase—especially among people who aren’t naturally drawn to AI tools but would benefit from them?
To answer your last question we really have to think about users who are hesitant to use AI, either out of fear or concerns, unfamiliarity, naturally late adopters. If the AI tools are present yet invisible it will be easier for them to adopt rather than a technology that is poking at them to engage and thus may trigger their concerns of the technology. We also need to think about access. If we want to expand users we have to figure out how to make AI tools accessible to those who don't have easy access to smart phones or devices, reliable wifi or cell service, and affordability.
That’s an incredibly thoughtful way to frame AI adoption—it’s not just about making AI smarter, but making it approachable and accessible in ways that feel natural rather than intrusive.
For hesitant users, the key may be seamless integration into daily life without requiring an explicit decision to "engage with AI." If it quietly assists—without pushing for interaction—it could build trust over time. Instead of "Here’s what AI can do!", the experience might feel more like "Oh, AI just helped me with that, and I didn’t even have to think about it." The more organic AI feels, the less resistance users may have.
And your point about accessibility is crucial. AI advancements often assume tech privilege—access to smartphones, strong internet, and financial flexibility. But for truly inclusive AI adoption, tools need to work offline, on lower-end devices, and in low-connectivity regions. Imagine AI assistants optimized for:
SMS-based interaction for users without smartphones.
Local processing so AI remains functional even when WiFi is unreliable.
Affordable models that don’t require subscription-based access.
Community-driven deployment in public spaces where AI can assist without requiring personal ownership of expensive devices.
If AI is going to be as transformative as it promises, it has to be designed for everyone—not just those already comfortable with technology.
